### Quantifying the impact of COVID-19 control measures using a Bayesian model of physical distancing

This repository contains code associated with a manuscript investigating
the impact of COVID-19 control measures in British Columbia, Canada. Here is the preprint: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.17.20070086v1. 

The main statistical model written in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) is
available [here](analysis/seeiqr.stan) and the main R function that
calls this model for a vector of daily case counts is available
[here](analysis/fit_seeiqr.R). A function to make projection plots is
available [here](analysis/make_projection_plot.R). 

A more fully featured and documented version of this model, which can accommodate multiple types of case data at once (e.g., reported cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions) and estimate segments of positive-case sampling fractions for reported cases, is also available as an R package [covidseir](https://github.com/seananderson/covidseir).

Generally, any part of the analysis can be re-created by running one of
the numbered R files starting with `01-...R` in the
[`analysis`](analysis) folder. Alternatively, the file
[`00-run-all.R`](analysis/00-run-all.R) can be sourced to run the entire
analysis.

You will need the following packages installed:

``` r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "remotes", "rstan", "here", 
  "future", "deSolve", "furrr", "cowplot", "reshape2"))
remotes::install_github("seananderson/ggsidekick")
```

An example of how to run the model:

``` r
library("rstan")
library("dplyr")
library("ggplot2")
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE) # cache the compiled model
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores() / 2) # Stan parallel processing
seeiqr_model <- rstan::stan_model("analysis/seeiqr.stan")
source("analysis/fit_seeiqr.R")
source("analysis/make_projection_plot.R")

d <- readr::read_csv("data-generated/daily-cases.csv")
d

```

``` r
# Using fewer iterations for a quick example:
fit <- fit_seeiqr(d$cases, seeiqr_model = seeiqr_model,
  iter = 300, chains = 4)
```

``` r
print(fit$fit, pars = c("R0", "f2", "phi"))
